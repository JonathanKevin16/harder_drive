## Features
- **Randomly Refuses to Store Files**: Because clearly, your files arenâ€™t that important.
- **Sarcastic Error Messages**: Get judged by your file system with every operation.
- **Initiates Conversations**: Engage in deep, philosophical discussions about your file storage choices.
- **File Encryption/Decryption**: Because hiding secrets is just so much fun.

## Why Use It?
Honestly, I needed to refresh my mind about Python and dive back into coding with a project thatâ€™s both challenging and delightfully absurd. Plus, everyone needs a file system that makes them chuckle.

3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
